# Case Study 3 on Ontology Matching -- `Maching Ontologies with LLMs`

This case study examines the application of the **REPRO** framework to existing ontology matching research within the field of knowledge engineering. Specifically, we explore the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for ontology matching through a different study of researchers titled **LLMs4OM: Matching Ontologies with Large Language Models**.



### Results Table

## How to Run the Experiments for REPRO?

1. Clone the https://github.com/HamedBabaei/LLMs4OM repository.
2. Place the provided shell scripts of the current directory in the `LLMs4OM/scripts` directory of the LLMs4OM work.
3. Run the shell scripts to automatically execute all experiments for the RQs in this study.
