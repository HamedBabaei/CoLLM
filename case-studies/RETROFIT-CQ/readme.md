# Case Study 5 on RETROFIT-CQs -- Retrofitting CQs from Existing Ontologies Using LLMs

This case study examines the application of the **REPRO** framework to **RETROFIT CQs** within the field of knowledge engineering. Specifically, it explores **RETROFIT CQs**, leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to retrofit competency questions (CQs) from existing ontologies. This study is based on the work of researchers, titled **An Experiment in Retrofitting Competency Questions for Existing Ontologies**.
